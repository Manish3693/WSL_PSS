This project aims to find the optimal perturbation in indicators to generate the best outcome in crop productions that are stable. To that end, we have done 1D and 2D modelling, where we observe the changes that occur in the capability vector with a perturbation. 

The PE(main) consists of all the codes regarding this.

Maize Prescriptive is the code that takes a target maize production and the factors we consider are the most contributing to it and estimate the changes needed in each of the factors to cross the target.
